# Assets and Libraries

Not included due to copyright - get your own.

You need:

-   libraries
-   natives
-   game assets
-   index.json

You can run `npm run downloadLibraries` to download everything except game assets.

You should also deobfuscate the Minecraft JAR using the MCP mappings (not required, but helps for debugging).
