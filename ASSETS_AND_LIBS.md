# Assets and Libraries

Not included due to copyright - get your own.

You need:

- libraries
- game assets
- index.json

You can run `npm run downloadMinecraftFiles` to download everything.

You should also deobfuscate the Minecraft JAR using the MCP mappings (not required, but helps for debugging). (TODO: add a script to do this)
