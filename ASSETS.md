# Assets

Not included due to copyright - get your own.

You need:

-   libraries
-   natives
-   index.json

All of them can be transferred over from a normal installation.

You'll need to put them in `public/mc`

You should also deobfuscate the Minecraft JAR using the MCP mappings (not required, but helps for debugging).

(TODO: make a script to do this)
