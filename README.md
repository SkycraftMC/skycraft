# Skycraft

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run downloadMinecraftFiles
npm run dev
```

Downloading the MC files is **CRUCIAL** for running Skycraft, as we cannot provide them due to copyright. This should take a few seconds. **DO NOT** distribute the Mojang copyrighted files.
When pushing to Git, Skycraft keeps the `mc` folder in `.gitignore`.

In the project's current state, you should **NOT** host Skycraft on the public internet.

You also need to download the assets (TODO)
